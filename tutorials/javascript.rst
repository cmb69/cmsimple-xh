JavaScript
==========

CMSimple_XH is mainly developed in PHP. To improve the user
experience browser-side scripting is necessary; this is done
directly in the ECMAScript implementations of the browsers (i.e.
no precompiled language such as CoffeeScript or TypeScript is used).
This is documented in the separate
[JavaScript Documentation](../js/index.html).

jQuery
------

Due to the fact that several major JavaScript frameworks may not be
compatible with each other and the popularity of
jQuery_ this is the only JavaScript
framework that is officially endorsed by CMSimple_XH. All
CMSimple_XH extension writers are advised to use
jQuery4CMSimple_,
if they want to use jQuery, jQueryUI and/or jQuery plugins.
